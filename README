This is the code that makes up demo.redlibre.org. This is developed by me, by kind permission from redlibre.org, so if it's broken, then don't blame redlibre.org. :) To install it, get a debian lenny server (I got one at rackspace and can recommend them), run:

 * apt-get update
 * apt-get upgrade # (hit enter for default answers to configuration question)
 * apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5

All of this, as well as what follows, has to be run as root, or with 'sudo' in front of it, obviously. Now run a2enmod to install the following modules:

 * a2enmod headers # (it will say to restart apache for each of these, but we'll restart it later anyway)
 * a2enmod dav
 * a2enmod dav_fs

If you hadn't downloaded this repository onto your server yet, do so now:
 * wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/DemoRedlibreOrg/tarball/master
 * tar -xzvf master
 * cd michiel-unhosted-DemoRedlibreOrg-* # (see my little bash trick there? ;)


Now, if your domain is called 'my.domain.org', then run the following from this directory to put in the right domainname:

 * sed -i -e 's/dev.unhosted.org/my.domain.org/g' apache2.conf
 * sed -i -e 's/dev.unhosted.org/my.domain.org/g' unhosted/html/.well-known/host-meta 
 * mkdir -p unhosted/dav/my.domain.org/demo

Change the html/unhosted_includes/settings.php

Now put everything into place, chown the web content, and restart apache:

 * mv apache2.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
 * mv unhosted/ /var/www
 * chown -R www-data /var/www
 * /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
